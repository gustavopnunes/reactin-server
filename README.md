# ReactIn-server
<p> This project was made as a challenge for Provi. I chose Linkedin because it's the social network I spend more time at the moment.  </p>

I don't have much to say about the server, there's only a /users route and one default user setted for tests. 
Route is opened for new users registration and update data (only if owner).
